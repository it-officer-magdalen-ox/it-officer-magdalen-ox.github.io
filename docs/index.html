              Welcome! The Magdalen College Middle Common Room is a vibrant community of postgraduates (and fourth year undergraduates). We organise several social and welfare events every week to keep our students sustained during the terms of academically rigorous study. Highlights of these over recent terms have included honey and chocolate tastings, tea and boardgames, as well as our standing events such as Liquid Lounges (casual bar night) and Sunday Brunches. In collaboration with the JCR (Junior Common Room, undergraduates) we maintain a well-curated art collection, with a frequent rotation of pieces into the MCR's physical space. This is complemented by a friendly MCR Committee, who look forward to welcoming you to our ranks soon!

              <p>
                Q: Where is the MCR?
              </p>
              <p>
                A: The MCR can be found at the top of Staircase 8 in Cloisters.
              </p>

              <p>
                Q: What are the opening hours of the MCR?
              </p>
              <p>
                A: The MCR is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You are asked to be quiet in the evenings.
              </p>

              <p>
                Q: Is there WiFi in the MCR?
              </p>
              <p>
                A: Yes. Both OWL and Eduroam are available.
              </p>

              <p>
                Q: Can I go up the Great Tower?
              </p>
              <p>
                A: Yes. The first time you go up, you’ll need to go with somebody who has already been up the tower. Your ever-thoughtful MCR organises trips up the tower in Fresher’s Week to make sure you’re able to go up yourself if you should so choose at a later date. You will need to collect a permission form from the Porters and get it signed by a Fellow in College before you’ll be given the key to go up.

                Q: What is my postal address?

              <p>
                Q: How do I report a maintenance issue?
              </p>
              <p>
                A: Complete the online <a href="http://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/maintenance-request">Maintenance Request</a> form. You can report issues in communal areas as well as in your own room. If it is an emergency, contact the Porters.

            <h2 class="section-title">Dress Codes</h2>
            <div id="dress">
              <p>
                You'll quite often get invited to things where there is a dress code in Oxford. Here's an external <a title="http://www.dresscodeguide.com/" href="http://www.dresscodeguide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide</a>. And a snappier guide written by an MCR member some years ago:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Casual: You can wear what you like (within reason). Jeans and trainers are acceptable.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Smart Casual:Women: Smart top or blouse, jacket or cardigan if you like, smart trousers/skirt to match jacket and tidy shoes or boots (avoid trainers if possible).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Lounge suit/Smart:
                    <br>
                    &emsp; Men: A dark suit (with matching jacket and trousers), collared shirt and tie (but not bow tie), black shoes required. 
                    <br>
                    &emsp; Women: Cocktail dress (length just above the knee to just above the ankle).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Black Tie: 
                    <br>
                    &emsp; Men: Black tuxedo (silk or satin lapels and ribbon seam on the outside of the trouser legs to match jacket), white dress shirt with cuff links, black silk or satin bow tie, and black shoes. A waistcoat or cummerbund is optional. Formal national dress is also acceptable. 
                    <br>
                    &emsp; Women: A long flowing dress or cocktail dress, typically more elegant than worn for a lounge suit dress code. At balls a long ball gown is appropriate.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    White Tie:

A black top hat and white gloves are optional. Formal national dress is also appropriate. 
                    <br>
                    &emsp; Women: A long ball gown reaching at least the ankles or the ground.
